<title>Movie Theater Data</title>

    <h1>Movie Theater Data</h1>
    <p style="font-size:0.85em">
        I started going to the movies a lot when I signed up for Moviepass in late 2017. Now, with the service falling apart,
        I thought it would be fun to take a look at the data on what I saw.
        <br><br>
        The charts were made with <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.</a> All the data is pulled out of a
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ex4A6yFXT0QUCWTioNcop896I6CWirV6ZZ3-H6UPvig/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet</a>
        on page load and parsed using <a href="https://www.papaparse.com/">Papa Parse.</a> Some of the data in the spreadsheet comes from
        <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb.</a> The ratings are pulled from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/whartman/"> my Letterboxd account.</a>
        I referenced <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318">these</a> <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/89c6bd879d64aa511372064c6cf85711">projects</a>
        for the calendar chart and <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/DimsumPanda/689368252f55179e12185e13c5ed1fee">this project</a> for the
        stacked bar chart. I used <a href="http://thomasf.github.io/solarized-css/">this stylesheet</a> for the Solarized Dark color
        scheme. The hatched fill was adapted from <a href="https://github.com/iros/patternfills"> this project.</a>
        <br><br>
        <ul style="font-size:0.85em">
          <li>"Non-premium" showings are considered to be 2D DCPs or on 35mm. Premium showings are anything that usually costs more money than regular â€” this includes
            just about anything else (3D, chain-specific premium brands, Dolby Atmos, any variety of IMAX, 70mm, etc).</li>
          <li>This chart doesn't include things at movie theaters that aren't movies. If it doesn't have an IMDb page, it isn't included.</li>
          <li>Prices paid don't factor in concessions, movie tickets I bought for other people, or any addon-style donations to non-profit theaters.</li>
          <li>If there are multiple kinds of fees (online booking fees, convenience fees, Sinemia fees) on a single ticket, they are all added together.</li>
          <li>"Gifts" can be an invite to a free screening, it doesn't have to be someone else paying for the tickets. "Free Tickets" are tickets that were
            offered as some kind of promotion or make-good.</li>
          <li>For double features, the top-billed movie is listed at full price under whatever service was used to buy the ticket. The second-billed movie is listed
            with a price of $0 under the "Double Feature" service.</li>
